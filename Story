Once upon a time there lived a monkey on the 
cherry tree. There was a lake beside the tree. 
A crocodile lived in it with his wife.

the crocodile and his wife were very hungry one day,
the crocodile came across the cherry tree and saw the
monkey eating cherries.

the crocodile asked the monkey if he would share 
the cherries with him.
